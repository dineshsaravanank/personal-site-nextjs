Stories facinate me. Stories have been the way we humans have communicated for thousands of years. Even before there were words, there were stories. Words, spoken or written, are how we communicate, but stories are **what** we communicate. 

When the first human wanted to share their experience, that is when stories started. The cave person drew on the wall, but the drawing would mean nothing if it didn't tell a story. Herds of Animals, hunters, prints of hands, and majestic predators are all subjects of early paintings. They stand to tell us stories of people long gone. But they speak of awe, or at least that is how we interpret it.

The listener is as important as the storyteller. A story retold the same way, with the exact words, in the same form might still be different for different listenersâ€”therein lies the beauty of the stories. 

Words spoken by God retold verbatim, resisting interpretation, still capture one's emotions differently. The spiritual experience of the listener is unique to the listener.

And this is why stories fascinate me.

I am starting this blog to capture the effects of stories on me. Along the way, I plan to tell a few of my own too. Dear reader, hopefully, the tales I tell here facinates you as well.
